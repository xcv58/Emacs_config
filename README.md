Emacs config
========
Only work on Emacs 24 and later!

I just test on OS X Version 10.9 and Ubuntu 13.10 x64.

If you have your own ~/.emacs.d directory.

Please backup your configuration.

After clone:

You can move Emacs\_config to ~/.emacs.d

```
mv Emacs_config ~/.emacs.d
```
or
```
ln -s Emacs_config ~/.emacs.d
```

And enjoy!
